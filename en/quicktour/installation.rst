Installing the sandbox
======================

The Vespolina Sandbox demo's a lot of the features Vespolina offers. While
it's possible to use as a development platform, it's not intended as such.

Requirements
------------

 - PHP > 5.4.0 (5.3 might work...)
 - MongoDB (at this moment DBAL is not yet fully supported)

Getting the code
----------------

The recommended way is to clone the sandbox from: https://github.com/vespolina/vespolina-sandbox.git

Then you can use `composer install` to download the dependencies.
